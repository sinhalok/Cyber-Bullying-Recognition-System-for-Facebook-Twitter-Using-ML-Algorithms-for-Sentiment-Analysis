60,United States presidential election 2016,Former Mexican president slams Trump's 'stupid wall',"Hillary thinks saying 'everybody accepts big money' somehow exonerates her from being part of the establishment problem. She is the leading tip of the rigged system, getting the most Wall Street money, while having the fewest individual supporters. She's living in a skewed reality bubble with the other establishment money cronies.Also, Bill Clinton and Obama were never Secretary of State and both had no foreign policy experience. Yet, they did great. And Bernie would never pick someone like Hillary to be secretary with her poor judgement. So clearly, foreign policy experience is NOT needed for the job. Period. The end. #BernieNotForSale"

It is now a general understanding by the public that the HK Police will not arrest those people because they are coomunities with strong pro~china political influences and supporters of our current Chief Executive Leung Chun Ying, these people sort of became like those of ""untouchables"" ."

1230,United States presidential election 2016,Former Mexican president slams Trump's 'stupid wall',"Trust me, Mexico will pay. Either through tolls for crossing the border, increased tariffs and taxes on imports from Mexico, or perhaps even deductions in financial aid given to Mexico. I believe America gave $420 million dollars in financial aid to Mexico in 2013. I think that would be a fantastic start to financing a fantastic Border Wall. Hell, that's how we can finance the deportation of all those illegal immigrants too. We send hundreds of millions of dollars to Central and South American countries in finacial aid. And they still come to our country. Seems a better use would be to use that aid money to send them back, and then allow the best and the brightest back into our country legaly if they so choose. The thing is, a politician would never consider this possibility, but a businessman would."

When he referred to a wall it was a defensive posture on immigration rather than a huge wall blocking the entire world from coming into the US.  People think he is full of hate, he isn't, he wants our country to be heading in a different direction. People have gotten so hung up on the fact he isn't a politician they make assumptions that he is a bad man. So what! He is saying things that need to be said.

For those who support him, America will be anything but great if he is elected.  We will be in multiple wars since his solution to every problem is war and violence.  We will be weak because we don't have enough ammunition to protect us from Trump's big mouth.  I cannot believe Americans are standing behind a man that in ONE day has tried to bully the Mexican president and making crude comments at his rally."

3655,United States presidential election 2016,Former Mexican president slams Trump's 'stupid wall',"Vidya And AvidyaVedas clearly state: knowledge of vedas is called brahma vidya or simply vidya (knowledge of the truth); all other forms of knowledge fall under avidya (or ignorance of the truth). You know that I have started a series in the facebook imparting brahma vidya, the knowledge of truth, as given in 108 Upanishads!My long professional experience in teaching and research in many fields other than vedas, unfortunately, encouraged me to write in various social media platforms on diverse issues as education, economic development, religious amity, anti-national activities of opposition parties, media and religious fanatics etc! After studying vedas and getting engaged in imparting veda knowledge, I should really refrain from all other activites that can cause distractions and affect my main Vedic work.So I have decided to concentrate only on spreading the veda message across the world! My posts are public and people are free to read my posts and use the knowledge to rise themselves to a higher level! Those who choose to criticize the Vedas too are free to do so! Vedas need not be defended by anyone; if intellectual debates over 5000 years have accepted vedas as the basic premises, nothing more is needed to defend them!In short, no more posts from me on topics other than Vedas and related literature; of course, all important scientific discoveries and concepts supporting the Veda assertions will be presented! No more presidential election, Donald Trump, Modiji, Kejriwal, Mughal and British invaders, dismal education system etc. from me! Only vidya and no avidya! Be certain, avidya is the root cause of all evils in the world! There is one final request: those who like my series may do the needful to spread this divine veda message to others! Good luck to all!"

Second, how can anyone still believe in Trump. all he's made up of is insinuations, criticism and exaggerated comments. He doesn't have any specific solutions. Except to say. I will make America great again. But, can't say how. I have never seen anyone, so shallow, go so far. Get past the angry aggressive attitude. Be fair to yourself. John Kasich is the only Republican that has the ability, ideals and capability to run this Country. That's even close to Hilary, which is still second to her. W/ Hilary's experiences, First Lady, Secretary of State and Senate, Along w/ Her husbands record as president ( who will be in the White House w/ her). There is no one, that even comes close, to having more knowledge, back ground and success w/ the economy, foreign policy, global warming and world threat than the two of them. For those that, justifiably, hold Bill's indiscretion against him. I say it was wrong, but, if Hilary has accepted it, than so can I for the benefit of the Country..Also, Benghazi was a horrible mistake. It's hard to overcome. But, if you think that any of the candidates are above making the same mistake or worse. Your kidding yourself."

863,United States presidential election 2016,Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders? Some voters can't decide,"Iowans. Look at the profiles in all Facebook pages associated with Hillary Clinton. You will see cut and paste comments from several different profiles. Now, look at the faceless profiles, dogs, cats. Flowers, really..the Clinton foundation has employed hundreds of people that use thousands of fake Facebook pages. She is being dishonest. Now, look at the rally pictures of her supporters. Hair up, hair down, hat, no hat, its the same people. She supply's her own crowds. Don't you get it? Its the Clinton foundation. Its what it was designed for. Its not a charity its an election machine designed to fool the masses...please do your own research. Here is an example. If you watch the news your aware of the water crisis in flint Michigan, and you have probably seen Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton talking about it. Hillary talks about it in her speeches, she talks about it on her Facebook page, she talks about it in the television interviews.... She expresses great concerns over it...but all she does is talk, talk, talk, talk. Look, if you go to Walmart and buy a single bottle of water and send it to a random resident of flint Michigan then you all by yourself would be doing more for that resident than the Clinton campaign and Clinton foundation COMBINED!!!! Ask yourself, why is Chelsea always doing something other than working at the foundation? She make $600K a year. If she's not needed then why are the people who are actually doing the work being paid EQUALLY? PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH... DONT LISTEN TO ME, GO LOOK UP THE FACTS FOR YOURSELVES.."

Since extremism to the left and to the right there is no difference.   Is like extremely cold or extremely hot, either way you put it is harmful.You do not shower with extreme cold water or very hot water.   Common sense in general call for a middle grown.   Socialism in a capitalist country will not work.   Is something that is unfair for the person who work hard to raise a family and show the family the values and the way to develop and advance in life with hard work and sacrifice to get ahead in life.   Socialism can get out of place and fall in a communism, and under Socialism, revel people can create havoc by force and can create a government like in Cuba and Venezuela.   In the part of extreme right Conservatism falls in a position where the Government want to control your religion, your way of life, the prejudice they have against people of color.   Trump in Office will end the  equal employment Opportunity, will end the right to Unions in this Nation, the NAACP, the Commission Against Discrimination, will end the right to peaceful assembly.Many of our rights, liberties and freedoms will be taking away by tapping phone lines and Internet of every individual.   It will promote the White Supremacy in all the States and U. S. Will become more like taking the U. S. to over 60 years back.  U.S. will be a democracy just for the rich and millionaires and more like a slavery for the middle class and the poor. True democracy only exist in the middle.   Being progressive or Moderate. It is like dealing with the faces of two evils.   Even Jesus plead to the masses not to be neither too hot or to cold but a person of the middle.   That is where common sense rest."

I know that even if we get free education for all now, we will pay it back in taxes later but the government will have to flit the bill now. So this will be  a tough decision, Sanders or Trump.

We also have to remember that we live in a global economy now more than ever. US products USED to be in hi demand. 2016? Not so much. Companies like Walmart almost insist on products being made in China. Watch an episode of Shark Tank. The very first thing they ask prospective investees(?) Is how can you get the cost down, and having it made in China is always the 1st alternative. Bernie believes that it's still 1960 and everyone in America is buying a Buick or a Chevy, and that everything we buy can be made in the US by workers making $15.00 an hour. Sadly those days are over."

Time Warner who owns CNN must be getting scared of Bernie since there part of her SuperPac. As they should be. And just seeing this post confirms there desperation. My question's for people areDo you want other countries to start buying from America, or continue to profit from other countries?Should corporations be able to stash money overseas and not pay taxes on it?Do you shop at Walmart? If so, your already paying rent for the employees who work for the richest company in the US. Would you like your kids to go to college if they made good grades and you couldn't afford it?If you have to go to the hospital or someone you love has to, should they leave broke, or die because they don't want the bill?Should our next president be bought buy Banks, Pharmaceutical companies?Or by a man who has no political experience at all, just a big bank account and a lot of hate?Do you know why the Republican party will not announce that climate change is real? Here's the answer.....then they'd lose money from there donors. Who cares about the world they leave for there children and grandchildren. I will say I have no kids, no intention of having kids, and work 40 hours a week, and I live in poverty. Yet I would gladly pay a little more in taxes to help our Country move forward in the right direction.And how quickly people forget we bailed out the banks, the car industry, Wallstreet, with OUR money, and got nothing back when they became successful again.Who is the candidate who will change this?.....there is only ONE Bernie!!!"

I strongly believe she should be the President of the United States as of 2017"
15431,United States presidential election 2016,Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders? Some voters can't decide,"I am a 48 year old male born and raised in Flint Michigan .  I am a member of the Democratic National Committee and a Union Ironworker I an also a Military Vet. I studied political science at the University of Michigan too. This is a small essay on why I'm voting for Bernie.  I hope you will read this and consider what I've said.  Thank you!I was a Hillary supporter.  I didn't like Bernie. Thought he looked like a wild scientist more than presidential. My daughters are in college and have never cared about politics.  All of a sudden I heard them having in depth political conversation about the direction this country is going. They were talkin about Bernie Sanders. They said they really liked him.  They didn't like him cause he has style or because he's cool.  They like him because they are tired of the wars their generation is fighting.  They're afraid of the Next War having a draft. They believe in his message.  Having been in military conflicts. w 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne). Trainig Contras in Nicaragua. I can empathize.  I agree wall street is rigged. I agree banks need to be broke up the way Republican President Teddy Rosevelt did with the first anti trust laws to break up momopolies.I think we need a masive shake up in DC and wall street.  We need Campaign Finance reform to remove ""McCain/Feingold"" and ""Citizens United.""  I think Hillary is too close to the problem to be able to fix it.  I have trust issues.  Why won't she release the transcipts to all the speaches she gave to the banks??  Cause they love her and she thinks the banks have been midunderstood???  She has Super Pacs and big$ banks financing her campaign.  Bernie has over 3 million individual campaign donors averaging $27.00 each.  And he's pulling in as much as her.  That alone proves Super Pacs are not necessary. The power is still eih the people who vote. Bernie has experience of 30 yrs fom Mayor to Congress to the Senate.  He knows his way around.This election means alot to everyone. But not as much as it does to our Youth. I have to consider the welfare of my kids  It may be the most important election of our lifetime but especially theirs. WW3 is coming trust me! With a draft including women. There's a bill in the house right now to add women to the draft.  Why if they don't expect a big war would they need a draft?  This election is the biggest of our lives and I have to consider my kids and the future.  Too often we live in the here  and now without thinking ahead.  Iraq is an example.  G.W. didn't think about the 10 yrs down the road or the power vacuum attacking Iraq would leave.  Bush Sr. and Col. Colin Powell did.  It's why they stopped short of Bagdad in Desert Storm and set up no fly zones that were working.  I think like a soldier.  I smell death, you never forget, I see the blood, the death of children.  I see their bodies in the street bloading. So many that they rot for days weeks before we can bury them.  The sickening sweet smell of dead bodies is everywhere.  Then there's the wide spread distruction.  The desimation of historical sights that have lived through a thousand years of war til this one.  Thousands of years of history that lynks us all together... gone forever.  Our kids and grand kids will never be able to see these beautiful historic sights or learn about them.  They're gone now.  War is a terrible terrible thing and too often we set here insulated from it and forget it's even going on.  Comfortable in our warm homes while the war rages on.  Then there's the war that comes home with them.  PTSD, Maimed, loss of limbs etc. It never ends for many of them.  The last war generation.  (Vietnam)  Brought us Kennedy and Johnson. It was the young college aged kids that voted for them. Did they make a mistake?  I ask only because Hilary. Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinberg has insinuated that's what our young people are doing now. Telling them they're just following Bernie Sanders for the boys or going to hell if they don't vote for Hillary. I am going with my gut. I'm supporting my kids.  My life is set.  I wont have to fight.  I'll be ok.  They wont and they have their whole lives ahead of them.  I don't want to see it snuffed out for a unjust war that started on lies of WMDs.  We had a right to get Bin Laden in Afghanistan, that was a just war. We should have stayed focussed there and Laden would have been caught long long before.  Bernies strategy for the Middle East  makes sense .  He wants to commit no US troops  on the ground .  We can give air support  intelligence  and financing .  The only U.S. ground troops will be Special Forces in an advisory capacity .  All ground fighting will be done by a coalition  of neighboring Muslim nations .  The Saudis  the Jordanians  the Turks  and the Egyptians. If United States were to invade it would be perceived by terrorist as a holy war... Christians against Muslims. And that is exactly what ISIS wants. The war must be fought Muslim against Muslim in order for it to be viewed as a just war to them. They have to clean up their own backyard. No more young American men and women shedding their blood for a war that should have never taken place had Middle East not been destabilized by the Iraqi invasion. Bernies plan makes sense and his attitude, fortitude, experience and judgment is what we need as our Commander and Chief right now. This is my oppinion.  It's why I support Bernie and I hope you will join me! Feel The Bern!!"

14574,United States presidential election 2016,"The Polling Snapshot: Heading to New Hampshire, poll overload","The Democratic Party is a classic caste system. First you have their Lower Class peoples. This is the engine that subjugates low income people, minorities and immigrants by forcing them to live on minimum wages, public housing, welfare, food stamps, and free medical benefits on the most impoverished people in this county with no viable means or legitimate avenue to obtain a fair and equitable living. These people have been in this classification for their entire lives. They have less education, fewer people are given the opportunities. Now they need and want to incorporate and legalize over 11 million illegal immigrants who have invaded our country and begin a process of bringing hundreds of thousands of Arabic people to add to this group.Then you have their consolidated middle class. This is their engine of union workers across all industries, individual family farmers, agricultural workers, and minority business owners. Union workers are afforded the benefits of Prevailing Wages and Fringe benefits. Prevailing wages are established in each and every job classification that exists. The pay and benefits given to Union members is 3 times to 5 times more income then their lower class voters. Those in their middle class are generally homeowners, receive guaranteed pay and benefits during an entire career and their jobs are protected politically. Farmers and agricultural workers receive farm and crop subsidies. This is arguably the largest welfare plan ever devised in this country. If crops fail, don't worry about it...they'll simply be paid a subsidy through the Farmer Bureau at the end of the season. If they have a great year, don't worry about it...we'll still pay you the same subsidies. If a company with union employees looks like it's going to fail, don't worry...we'll bail you out so our union voting base remains intact. The makeup of most Unions in our country are white males and women by an extremely huge margin. Unions spend millions supporting Democrats across this country. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have received millions from unions over their careers as have most Democratic politicians. ""Cometh to the well and you shall drink!""But above all else is the Upper Class. These are the rich, the bankers, the automakers, the owners of the majority of newspapers, broadcasting companies and the manufacturing corporations. This rich in the Democratic party are amount the richest Americans in the history of our county. Two simple examples here would be Warren Buffet and his Berkshire Hathaway fund. Arguable one one of the most powerful men in our country. There will never be a pipeline build as long as Burlington Northern Santa Fee railroad is carrying millions of barrels of oil to the refineries. No bank that supports the Democratic Party will be allowed to fail. Evidenced by the fact Goldman Sachs is one of the greatest donors for Hillary Clinton. ""Cometh to the well and you shall drink!""This is the Democratic caste system as a whole. The largest majority of the Lower class are destined to remain in this class their entire lives with little hope of ever moving out of it. The Democratic Party need this class to win elections. They do so to win elections because those in the lower class are less educated and would never be allowed to move up into the middle class. They will simply never be given the means. There has never been an election where the Democratic Party and those politicians running have not promised the end their lives in this Lower class. There has never been any progress for these people as a group after any election. What is even more sad....in the past 8 years, under Obama...the total number of people in the Lower class has grown. The rich did get richer, but they are destroying the middle class to ensure they have their largest voting base guaranteed. Now they want and need to incorporate 11 million illegal immigrants and suffering Arabic peoples into this group."

Nafta, and the china treaties caused companies to run overseas and south of the border, while at the same time Clinton was forcing banks and lenders to give loans to ppl who were already spotty on credit to begin with. as factories got built and up to operating shipping parts and goods to the states. those same ppl started losing jobs to foreign competition. therefore, unemployment will NOT pay a mortgage or car payment so then they default on them. The bubble burst on it way after Clinton left office and has been unfairly given to Bush, when in fact it was all started with the signing of those liberal policies of Bill Clinton....... ppl tall about how good the economy was under Clinton well guess what? the reason is he INHERITED an economy set up by the previous administrations of Presidents, Reagan and Bush sr. was nothing Clinton did. The term Reaganomics was designed and further implemented by Bush for the pupose of making America great again, and worked until Clinton and his liberal cohorts decided to prop up China and Mexico and send OUR jobs overseas...... a vote for trump is the only sane choice"

On the other hand, they say they are leaning towards Donald Trump, who embodies all of the above. This is why it's easy to see that this election is not about business or purpose. But about passion and likability. Which is a dangerous composition when there is IMPORTANT WORK to be done.This is why DEDICATION, EXPERIENCE, CIVILITY AND COMMON SENSE, should lead the way.          HRC>>>>"

We are tired of career politicians lining their pockets all the while plunging us into record debt. The knowledge revolution has begun and their time is limited! When things go extremely wrong, the only way to correct it is to go extremely right. (Morally not politically) the DNC and the RNC are nothing but corrupt organizations that plot to steal money and create a need for their own existence by devaluing the dollar, raising taxes, punishing ambition, and for the sake of money, moving jobs out of this country. Time to hit the reset button and send all of these corrupt politicians to prison!"
14289,United States presidential election 2016,Why these Obama voters are backing Donald Trump,"This is a total bogus line, Trump is not even close to Obama's thick skin, intelligence and just plain understanding of our system of government.  But that's just the beginning, Obama has wade America though the greatest economic depression, greater than 1929; we still had Lehman Brothers, Merrrill Lynch, Bear Stearns.  These are the pillars of American financial power around the world, Lehman Bros was the only bank to sell bonds to build entire state economies in the South, after the Civil War ended.  They were the reason there is a Sear and Roebuck, many other iconic brands that existed for 130 years.  Yet in one month Bear Steans, Lehman, Merrill all fell like dominos.  This is known as systemic risk.  Had the US govt not raised $750 B and bailed out these and AIG the unemployment rate easily could have been 20% like in Spain not 10.7%.   So despite the uninformed who say our government policies do not work, the FDIC created in 1936 and other policies tightening Federal Reserve worked.  The long soup lines of 1929-19134 were avoided, the unemployment was 22% in 2009 unemployment peaked at 10.7%.  Today its 4.9%, even though labor participation rate is low, this very low unemployment level will force wage growth and push those who have given up on jobs to get back in the game.  The evidence of this is beginning to mount.  Trumps polices is ever implemented will tank the economy.  Bec he will not decrease taxes he will increase them on the middle class and he will choke of trade with Mexico and China, which will increase inflation"

Second, how can anyone still believe in Trump. all he's made up of is insinuations, criticism and exaggerated comments. He doesn't have any specific solutions. Except to say. I will make America great again. But, can't say how. I have never seen anyone, so shallow, go so far. Get past the angry aggressive attitude. Be fair to yourself. John Kasich is the only Republican that has the ability, ideals and capability to run this Country. That's even close to Hilary, which is still second to her. W/ Hilary's experiences, First Lady, Secretary of State and Senate, Along w/ Her husbands record as president ( who will be in the White House w/ her). There is no one, that even comes close, to having more knowledge, back ground and success w/ the economy, foreign policy, global warming and world threat than the two of them. For those that, justifiably, hold Bill's indiscretion against him. I say it was wrong, but, if Hilary has accepted it, than so can I for the benefit of the Country..Also, Benghazi was a horrible mistake. It's hard to overcome.

These monies flowed to his senatorial campaign, apparently without question or rejection.To make matters even stickier, it's pretty well known that the Democratic National Committee raises millions from Wall St every election cycle.

Now, Instead of real results and profits, it's all debt, which becomes the justification to raise taxes - on the rich.   But, the coolest thing about Socialism is debt comes with it automatically, and so do tax rates of 50%.  To deal with it, the government just keeps printing more money, which leads to greater inflation, so you get more and more people to go on strike, so they don't have to work. Some people will insist on producing, so you raise their taxes to 80% and make them slaves to your government."

579,United States presidential election 2016,Bush on Trump: 'The guy needs therapy',"If a great, powerful man, such as Trump doesn't win IMAGINE us with Hillary Clinton as president?Narcism is being confused with brains & boldness. Everything about Donald Trump gives me hope in America again. I am tired of illegal immigrants. Yes I am. I am stupified to why they are given a better way of life than our Vets who fought for the very freedom we enjoy!! Trump will end that. Trump will bring back jobs. Trump will bring back entrepenurship and small businesses and manufacturing. Trump will bring back order to the streets: cops won't be ridiculed!What is wrong with money? Absolutely nothing. Trump doesnt need anyone's $ he can't be bought and that is a G-d given gift. You need $ to live. In Trumps book ""The Art of the Deal"" he states he doesn't work for money because he has enough money. Wasnt King Soloman the wealthiest ruler?  Trump loves work and he is in excellent health at 70 to keep going. He has a very clear, forthright head on his shoulders another G-d given gift. The bible says you work hard, you will be rewarded. Trump's life is an American blueprint for success. Remember, God made Trump and I believe, exactly for this pre-destined moment in history.Trump can run a successful company, he can run a successful America.Trump is a friend of Israel. He & Bibi are great friends. Trump campaigned for Bibi during the last elections in Israel (a little publicized fact). Bibi won by a narrow margin last year.Trump will move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Israel where it should be. Trump knows too well the Christian beheadings & the war called ISIS and he will destroy that cancer before they destroy us. He is anti-mosques where hate is encouraged & the war against Christians is fostered. He will reform taxes. ISIS is a political agenda hidden behind religion.I find everything about Donald J Trump refreshing. Shall I go on ?He will give freedom to churches to speak anti-same sex marriages and teach sin without fear of closure.He will put G-d back in schools.He will not back Shariah Law.He protects the 2nd amendment.He will restructure mental health care in this country.He will do away with Obamacare (such a great bill you need a law to enforce it!!) The pharmaceuticals can't buy him.He will certainly fight for equality in the workplace.I believe he will dismantle Planned Parenthood. He doesn't need their $.In our world, knowledge is power & money is freedom! Trump has both in aces!! That's why I'm voting for President Trump!!! If the dems win they will be the death of Christianity. Our society will be socialistic. In socialism there is no G-d. Consider that.  Trump has a lot of work to do. He is the best one to get the job done. Let's support him so he can#MakeAmericaGreatAgainAmen and amen"

If you were the choice between Jeb Bush and down truck, it will be come any day. If you can't hold your own against Donald Trump then you have no place on the stage. I do like the Bush family but you're not your daddy or your brother. Were at a crossroads in this country. A pivotal moment in time where we need a leader that will stand up and identify who our enemy is and will act appropriately. We need a leader who will say what he means and mean what he says. Someone that are enemies no that they should fear. 2016 is the year of a major decision and which way this country is going to go and how this country and app. This is the most important election this country has ever faced since Reagan. And as far as the temperature goes, the day Ronald Reagan got an office I ran free. The hospital. That is what they will do to these people in the Middle East.

1669,United States presidential election 2016,Bush on Trump: 'The guy needs therapy',"(Re-posted re: #GOPDebate): NOT SO FAST, FOLKS! (Pun, sorry.) VOTER INSIDER PLATINUM and you're missing it???? This was fascinating. I have a theory: What does each candidate's behavior ""behind the scenes"" actually reveal? Replay the footage. Who went off script? Yeaaaahhhh, interesting coincidence, isn't it? Who used his weight to take control and stand beside his fellow candidate? And who, anxious to stay on cue and look sharp, continued to breeze past Dr. Carson? Stay with me. Now I could be mistaken, but isn't it possible that Mr. Trump, who has loads of TV experience, may have noticed that Dr. Carson missed the cue and, rather than thinking only of himself, decided to skip his cue deliberately and stand beside Dr. Carson (in a no-sweat-man-they'll-wait-we've-got-this-sort-of-symbolic-gesture)? Then, completely at ease, indeed waited for the next cue and let Dr. Carson actually go FIRST (the Only candidate to so thoughtfully and successfully do that ). What was interesting was to see how anxious other candidates were to move ahead and ""look the part "" or follow ""their cue."" Am I the only person that's struck by the symbolism here? Indeed it was a simple gesture, but I think it revealed more about Mr. Trump than the media is acknowledging. He tried to take a ""negative"" and re-brand it. I think the anecdote also says something about how much he admires Dr. Carson. What would have been even MORE fascinating to see perhaps is whether Mr. Trump would have stopped and done the same had it been another candidate. Moreover, nothing against Mr. Rubio, whom I admire and consider very talented, but a worried look crossed his face moments later that was intriguing to me; he's so perceptive that I actually wonder if he began experiencing regret that he didn't do what Mr. Trump did, realizing he walked ahead of Dr. Carson too. In other words, who really led here? Which of these men truly has the most confidence? Who took control of the narrative? Who helped his colleague? Who refused to let the script dictate the next move or rattle his poise? It sounds like a small thing -- but actually, it wasn't. It revealed something -- behind the scenes, a place that voters rarely get to observe. So people can tease ABC News all they want -- I'm actually grateful for the valuable insight. AND TO DR. CARSON'S CREDIT, his reaction also revealed things to me. It's my theory that he wasn't about to walk out on stage as another man's name was being called -- nor simply because a television producer was giving him instructions. He'd missed a cue but he didn't panic or react nervously; he remained poised and was intellectually assessing what his work-around would look like, which makes sense to me; he's a neurosurgeon after all. It's rather absurd for people to question how talented and intelligent this man is. It takes confidence not to panic when the script changes -- and to reach out and lend a hand, even at one's own expense (remember that debate Mr. Trump skipped --while he was raising support, awareness, for our veterans?). Honestly, it's a great quality in a leader. I learned a lot listening to the debate. But I may have learned even a little more DURING THE INTROS. Cc: Donald J. Trump, Dr. Ben Carson, ABC News"

The killer comet ( Jan 2037) and killer asteroid ( June 2040) according to the Book of Revelations would destroy one third of the land and one third of the sea respectively submerging countries like Britain, parts of USA ( California and San Francisco) and ancient civilizations. After the 3 1/2 Years of peace war will breakout in 2041. India will be occupied by China. China and Russia will annex and occupy USA and Europe will be devastated by the Islamic invaders by the Mahdi of Greater Arabia who sports a blue turban would see 200 million soldiers kill 3 billion people.

17757,United States presidential election 2016,Bush on Trump: 'The guy needs therapy',"Frankly, i think it's Jeb Bush that needs some form of mental evaluation to assess his competence to lead America. He keeps insulting Trump, even when his territorial exposure is severely limited, compared to Trump, who is vastly traveled across the globe, own assets in many continents. Trump is an independent right wing American gladiator interested in leadership to recreate America, in his own image as, Independent, prosperous and extremely powerful to scare others to submission. He sounds passionately American and desires to see an America that manifest economic might and vastly wealthy... dominating the global economy and political landscape.  No matter how absurd Trump sounds, he seem a lot more candid than many of his opponents. I don't share his views at all but, one can't den how impressive his appeal is among many Americans.  Trump is brutally blunt and candid, unlike Bush who struggles with how best to couch his arguments to win points. Jeb is dangerously duplicitous, coy and parochial, almost delusional about America exceptionalism."

He is adept at 'shooshing' (quieting others by making fun of the other person in his attempt to dominate). He does 'a spin'  twisting questions and making it 'look like' he answered. Other than bragging that he is 'great' I have not yet heard a solution to anything."

One thing that he said that I do not agree with and it doesn't matter whether it comes from a Republican or a Democrat is the support the candidate no matter who it is philosophy.  I guess that means if the candidate was a chimpanzee they would support that candidate?  It looks like a party first philosophy.  The same goes for Democrats.  Myself being an independent will vote for the better candidate regardless of what letter they are wearing.
20886,United States presidential election 2016,Bush on Trump: 'The guy needs therapy',"No, ole common core pro amnesty Jeb needs some therapy!

22047,United States presidential election 2016,Bush on Trump: 'The guy needs therapy',"Mary Lou S. Holmes, everything that you think you know about Trump is wrong!  His grandfather, a German immigrant, earned his money running brothels. Fred Trump, Donald's father, became a multi-millionaire through building Section 8 housing for welfare recipients.  Donald Trump was BORN wealthy, & is such a ""great businessman"", that he went to great lengths to disinherit his late brother's children from their share of their grandfather's fortune by persuading the grandfather to change his will. His 3 marriages to successively younger women speaks to his family values. ""Sharia law"" is unconstitutional, as is any official state religion.  No church, synagogue or mosque faces closure because of their teachings on same-sex marriage, just public unpopularity from society at large. Obamacare is just an effort to bring affordable health insurance to more Americans, something that should be a right of citizenship, like it is in EVERY industrialized country in the world, save ours. It is an effort to insure more people while appeasing the insurance companies. All hospitals must, by law (passed under Reagan), care for patients.  They pass the costs for the uninsured to the insured & taxpayers, raising everyone's rates. Why would he fight for equality in the workplace when he has made a career of hiring foreign workers through applying for visas. As for your fears about Christianity, you are wrong. Our Democrats are moderate & if you knew anything about American history, you would know that socialism in this country was founded by Christians & was, at one time, more prevalent.  Socialism is not the same as communism, which is atheistic in nature. No Democrat, no matter how liberal, has ever proposed anything like that. And caring for the poor, the sick, the elderly & the young are Christian values. The worship of money & the ""Gospel of Prosperity"" are NOT the teachings of Christ!"

25627,United States presidential election 2016,Bush on Trump: 'The guy needs therapy',"all racist ideology is inherently evil and subjugates human beings based on the color of their skin. Any symbol, group or organization that expounds these ideas has no place in our society.We will never forget Auschwitz,we will never forget the people that died or die at the hands of racism.We should all be proactive In fighting the evil social construct of racism. We haven't moved forward because we still retain some of the racist infrastructure of the past,we recently removed many confederate monuments all over the south which is great step forward but we still have to eradicate the racist groups and all confederate symbols. May The history teachers never let us forget,but its our duty as a society to remove these threats that hinder the liberty and well being of all human beings and the true freedom of a society.I call on all Americans to peacefully and ideologically fight racism,prejudice and discrimination.Our youth are the key to this battle and they are doing a great job,we must create a culture of disdain for all things racist.We as Americans must rip apart this evil status quo by uniting against all things that continue to let it taint our society.I don't believe ""everyone is racist"" that is a myth,a social construct, I do believe Everyone is equal,I do believe that all people all over the world are members of one giant family called humanity and I believe that every person on this earth has the right to pursue their dreams and reap the benefits of what they sow and that only cowards and fools would try to hinder anyone of this right based on the color of their skin.Let it be known throughout all America that there is a New culture arising,a culture that will treat all people equally,a culture where all people will enjoy the fruits of their labor,and a culture where those who perpetrate racism will be severely severly punished!In my eyes unfairly hindering a persons success or opportuinites based on their skin or sex is one of the most cowardly,weak,and evil things a person can do to someone.Racist people take the wealth,opportunities and life out of people with this kind of behavior,and the slightest hint of this behavior must not be tolerated and must be destroyed.This type of behavior is a disgusting immoral cancer of our society and it is up to all of us to stop this mindset by changing our society and culture to one that absolutely despises racism on all levels.We won the civil war,we are making changes with women's pay,voting,and military service,we have taken confederate monuments down in the south we are winning!Lets be redundant and continue the fight!!Lets make racial entitlements null and void,I would even say lets disban all racially based organizations of all colors and create centers of humanity,culture,and unity,America Centers,were we all may unite and grow as a nation,thank you and god bless America!"

26158,United States presidential election 2016,Bush on Trump: 'The guy needs therapy',"To all in my beloved New Hampshire. First, I hope you know we, absolutely, can't put a Republican in the White House. The last one set this Country back to before it's foundation. Second, how can anyone still believe in Trump. All he's made up of is insinuations, criticism and exaggerated comments. He doesn't have any specific solutions. Except to say. I will make America great again. But, can't say how. I have never seen anyone, so shallow, go so far. Get past the angry aggressive attitude. Be fair to yourself. John Kasich is the only Republican that has the ability, ideals and capability to run this Country. That's even close to Hilary, which is still second to her. W/ Hilary's experiences, First Lady, Secretary of State and Senate, Along w/ Her husbands record as president ( who will be in the White House w/ her). There is no one, that even comes close, to having more knowledge, back ground and success w/ the economy, foreign policy, global warming and world threat than the two of them. For those that, justifiably, hold Bill's indiscretion against him. I say it was wrong, but, if Hilary has accepted it, than so can I for the benefit of the Country..Also, Benghazi was a horrible mistake. It's hard to overcome. But, if you think that any of the candidates are above making the same mistake or worse. Your kidding yourself."

28793,United States presidential election 2016,Bush on Trump: 'The guy needs therapy',"Jeb Bush is the only GOP candidate who's not stirring up the deep-seated and unreasonable outright hatred (not merely dislike, but rabid hatred) of Hillary Clinton to get publicity and votes. You can actually see his discomfort and frustration in the Republican debates, as he stands by and watches the other candidates get so worked up over Hillary's mere existence that they neglect giving intelligent answers to questions and instead sputter and spit and foam at the mouth over Hillary Clinton. (None of them even mention Bernie Sanders, who is actually ahead of Clinton in the polls!) I'm a liberal Democrat, but I have renewed respect for Jeb Bush for trying to bring some dignity and substance to the presidential race. Unfortunately, he's fighting a losing battle as the Hillary-haters shout him down. He's right -- they ALL need therapy, or at least some intensive lessons in anger management. Their behavior is juvenile, violent, dangerous, and downright creepy."

The jokes men made about women, the lack of respect, the fight just to get a job. You could be a teacher or a nurse. How do we make them understand if they did not live it.

It's about a generation of women celebrating the possibility of a female president we can support- something we never really believed could happen, would happen.  Seen too many roadblocks, been told to shut up and sit down too long.  I remember want ads in the paper listing jobs by male and female.  I remember being denied jobs because that job should go to the head of a household (as if women were never the head of a household).  I remember when women couldn't even run in a marathon, couldn't be ordained, couldn't be a freaking member of the Stock Exchange.  THAT'S why they're laughing.  It's sheer joy.  One generation's support of Hillary should not be a problem with another generation who want to support someone else.  Celebrate with us the wonderful possibility that we have waiting so long for.

2793,United States presidential election 2016,Hillary Clinton's problem with young women,"Hillary was a Young Republican,  unlike Sanders, she wasn't really there in the middle of the Civil Rights movement in the 60s. Even though people can have radical conversions with age, she's honestly barely left of center.  She is a corporate shill, and was opposed to gay marriage until five years ago. She didn't even fathom the fundamental problem with TPP until she realized Sanders supporters were abandoning her because of her shocking,  blind, upper middle class original support of it...it also revealed her to be much less of an environmentalist than she claimed. Yes she's a feminist. Conservatives can also be feminist. Being feminist or a woman doesn't guarantee anything else about her politics,  to be truthful, other than she'll be a feminist. She's like a Reagan Era conservative,  people are ignorant if they don't see that.  She only seems very liberal contrasted to the great neoconservative WTF that's happened over time since the late 80s. Sanders is the best candidate for me, as a woman, period.

In trotting out Steinem and Albright, in playing herself as the poor persecuted female who should be voted for her gender rather than strengthening her ideas, Clinton has betrayed almost everything women have won over these years.  The younger men and women don't buy her game.  And mature men and women don't either."

That being said, all people young and old need to stop, think, investigate and then consider their choices.  Here are some sobering things to ponder, the entire House of Representatives is up for election, thirty four, or slightly more than one third of the Senate seats are also to be decided. Political analysts believe that two of the ten contested Democratic seats are a tossup and of the twenty four contested Republican seats up for reelection, only two are also a tossup. Within the next five years, three of the four of the current Supreme Court Justices will either die or retire, so the next President will nominate enough Justices to affect the nation for the next twenty five years, or more.  Consider your choices wisely.   We need to stop beating up our youth, they will have to bear the consequences of all of our choices for many years to come."

While yes, you could construe   these 13 words as a threat to women to force them to vote for Hillary, you could also take it in the larger context that other women should not propagate or support the anti-Hillary campaign that targets her sex and gender. Women don't have to support Hillary to see that menstruation jokes, wifey jokes, and ""women"" jokes are harmful to all women, not just Hillary. and that she deserves to be discredited like any of her male counterparts....by misrepresenting policy and dredging up the most minuscule dirt from her past.  Or perhaps trying to get her disqualified for a specific religion or fabricating her place of birth. You know...time honored American politics."

When I went to the University of Colorado in the early 60's, I was told by the Journalism Dept. that if I wanted to pursue Journalism as a career I would always be a Feature writer making $60. a week.  I wanted to write about news and sports. I did not have the know how to stand up to them. I floundered for awhile, but graduated with a degree in Elementary Education which was acceptable for a woman. I made sure my daughter knew she could do whatever she wanted and to always stand up for herself. I think many women of my generation and the next did the same. We should be proud that younger women know this. I think others just feel unappreciated and abandoned by the younger women after all their hard work. They shouldn't because that is what we wanted for them.  Having said this, I will vote for HRC not because she is a woman, but because if elected,Bernie will face Paul Ryan's House. That means no Single Payer, No Free College, No SS increase. It cannot change until after the census in 2020 because redistricting occurs after each census.  Republican Governors have gerrymandered the Districts to be overwhelming Republican.  HRC has a detailed plan that she will be more likely able to implement. I'm just sorry that young women will undoubtedly be disillusioned if Bernie is elected.  I'm done."

17967,United States presidential election 2016,Hillary Clinton's problem with young women,"Vidya And AvidyaVedas clearly state: knowledge of vedas is called brahma vidya or simply vidya (knowledge of the truth); all other forms of knowledge fall under avidya (or ignorance of the truth).  You know that I have started a series in the facebook imparting brahma vidya, the knowledge of truth, as given in 108 Upanishads!My long professional experience in teaching and research in many fields other than vedas, unfortunately, encouraged me to write in various social media platforms on diverse issues as education, economic development, religious amity, anti-national activities of opposition parties, media and religious fanatics etc!  After studying vedas and getting engaged in imparting veda knowledge, I should really refrain from all other activites that can cause distractions and affect my main Vedic work.So I have decided to concentrate only on spreading the veda message across the world!  My posts are public and people are free to read my posts and use the knowledge to rise themselves to a higher level!  Those who choose to criticize the Vedas too are free to do so!  Vedas need not be defended by anyone; if intellectual debates over 5000 years have accepted vedas as the basic premises, nothing more is needed to defend them!In short, no more posts from me on topics other than Vedas and related literature; of course, all important scientific discoveries and concepts supporting the Veda assertions will be presented!  No more presidential election, Donald Trump, Modiji, Kejriwal, Mughal and British invaders, dismal education system etc. from me!  Only vidya and no avidya!  Be certain, avidya is the root cause of all evils in the world!  There is one final request:  those who like my series may do the needful to spread this divine veda message to others!  Good luck to all!"

During the Cold War we had stability in our country, and the world, due to the threat of nuclear war with USSR. Our client countries always stayed in line to avoid provocation. Since 1991, the world is facing new challenges; civil wars, middle east instability, Islamic extremism, and Europe's questionable dedication to maintain post WW2 liberal socialism. The USA was born from anti-European values...we don't have a noble vs. peasant fiefdom system here, no tyrannical kings, as Europe had for centuries. We made ourselves on the concept of the frontier and old fashioned  ingenuity. You make your own way, which is why millions have come here from Europe and other places...you aren't labeled, your future isn't determined, you can be whatever you want to be, if you work hard enough. American capitalism and efficiency created the industry needed to save Europe from two world wars...our industrial output gave us the capability to fight a two front war in WW2, AND supply our allies with enough materials and resources to maintain their own militaries. Brits won't ever admit this, but DDay wouldn't have been possible without the USA. The Soviets, without lend/lease, might not have survived the battle of Moscow in 1941, and almost certainly would never have been able to invade Germany proper. Obama eschews our history because he isn't rooted in America. The illegimate son of a radical leftist African and a liberal globe trotting white woman, raised by his maternal grandparents in Hawaii. He has no identity of himself, let alone his adopted country. Being born here makes you a citizen, but doesn't answer any questions about your self identity. Doesnt answer the ""who am i"" question. So Europe is desperately trying to maintain its grasp on its citizens through socialism. Europe was powerful when it was capitalist...today Europe is weak. Your citizens will soon realize that paying 35%-45% of their money to the king is silly, and their money is better off in their own pockets. So we'll see what direction our country is headed...we've periodically put our heads in the sands in the past, but always get called to help the world in its problems. One thing for sure, you can take your socialism and shove it...we want our money in our pockets..."

Perhaps we need to focus more inward at the moment, but I would advise against this fortress mentality. I believe the world needs us whether they, or we, like it or not. We still lead the free world, even though we may not always be the best example of democracy or make the best decisions no other democratic state could muster what we can today. Maybe in the future India, Brazil, or a united Europe will replace us but as it stands the US is the most capable and most necessary to maintaining world order and democracy.

The conservative leaders have convinced citizens that our government is an evil empire to be done away with. ""Less government"" they cry. Never mind ""we the people"" are our gov't. Meanwhile corporations use the gov't to further their interests, ie, the U.S. military, tax havens/ loopholes, etc. They tell Americans their tax dollars are being wasted on gov't programs for the poor and needy. Our own Supreme court voted in Citizens United, which means the oval office can be bought by the highest bidder. Americans have no voice; corporations reign supreme. NAFTA cost Americans jobs. The TPP will remove more jobs. Americans are demoralized after having followed the yellow brick road. Trickle-down was, of course, a lie. Americans, who thought they'd get a piece of that pie, are realizing that Reagan and his cronies knew citizens would never benefit from the neoliberal agenda.

Imagine how disgusted America would be if Hillary Clinton would tolerate and cozy up to those who got caught having an affair with her husband. However, not only does Karen Kasich tolerate and cozy up to those who got caught endangering her children, she and her husband actually pay money to them too. It is doubtful that Hillary Clinton paid money to those who had an affair with her husband (unless it were to keep them quiet about it).

7391,United States presidential election 2016,Why the female generational divide for Hillary Clinton?,"Just speculating as others are on this post.... Older women recall their childhood when females were stigmatized and passed on for promotions because of their gender. So..maybe it is more important to them to see a woman become president . They see it as the ultimate victory in a long struggle. Younger women were raised in a different climate and don't necessarily see gender as an obstacle or a hindrance in achieving their goals. Therefore, they are putting more emphasis on the message not the gender of the messenger. Bernie Sanders is a progressive whose rhetoric resonates with young visionaries wanting to change the world. Also, despite Hillary's intelligence and achievements she stayed married to a philandering husband which is probably more intolerable to young independent women because it shows weakness and dependency on some level.    ( I am an older woman who had a tremendous amount of admiration for Hillary Clinton until last year.)"
7396,United States presidential election 2016,Why the female generational divide for Hillary Clinton?,"But this thought is once again insulting young women. We get it, that Hillary fought for things we have today. It doesn't mean that we need *her* specifically to carry on this fight, like she is the only one capable. We are strong women too! I fought to become a dentist. Let the old feminists pass the torch and let us have a chance to fight our own fight. Bernie Sanders allows us to BE the revolution instead of Hillary implying, ""get out of the way dumb millennials that have such a perfect life with everything handed to them. Let us real women fight for rights. You just better vote for me, though, or you're going to hell."" Hillary hasn't even presented any plans that will advance the feminist cause.

Trump is just plain crazy and Bernie Sanders will tax the middle class if given the chance, in order to make his agenda real. I've read comments from many people who really believe that they won't have insurance premiums for just a small tax increase. What will happen is that the middle class will have a huge tax increase, as the middle class always takes the big hit,  and anyone living in IL, like me (middle class), cannot take on another tax increase.

12517,United States presidential election 2016,The horror story of a Republican debate,"The difference between the Republican debates and the Democratic debates is very simple.

Those of us who have been lucky to be educated, enlightened and open minded are dragging the rest of the citizens kicking and screaming into change.  We are a huge diverse nation of immigrants and people who were slaves that are being propelled by science advancement into giving up many beliefs long held as words of God to comfort many. Religion is again clashing with freedom. The war brought us and Europe smack back into biblical times, to a people  who hold fast to a religion we do not understand. This prefaced by terrorism and dislike of our culture and values has caused us much fear and loss. Some are too afraid and too overwhelmed so they revert to hate. Simply, we have a huge split and the election brought people who want to be president more than caring how they do it. All they have done is uncovered the rotting wound, maybe now we can heal it."

It's appalling.  The reason my husband and I quit watching the news years ago.   We just stuck to FOX and they are getting just as bad as the rest. Since Dr Carson has been running for President, I've seen the media try and destroy him with lies.  He has bounced back and proved the lies not to be true, but the media has NEVER corrected the accusations or apologized.  Dr Carson flat out told the media he was declaring war on them.  That took guts to do. Who else has done this to the extent he has. Now I'm seeing and hearing the media leaving Dr Carson out of everything they talk about and post.  Just yesterday there was a picture FOX posted on their show of all the candidates in NH - everyone BUT DR CARSON.   I listen to the radio in the morning and on my way to work.  The media taking about all the other candidates BUT NOT DR CARSON.  At one time we could look to the media for information and trust them. We CAN'T TRUST them ANYMORE.  When the media lied about Carson going to West Point, the two people on our afternoon news radio show was slamming Carson and calling him a liar and laughing.

Going to sleep as a whey-faced school boy, I would listen for planes wondering if one might be carrying THE BOMB. Now, for some reason, that doesn't seem to be a big concern, as if the destructive power of 50,000,000 tons of TNT - a Therom's punch - isn't our kryptonite any longer. The boogie man changes his masks, even as his insatiable appetite to tax, tax,tax knows no limit. His thirst for Draconian power is quest with out a border, encroaching deeper and deeper into our lives, directing us in cattle cars to some platitude defined BRIDGE TO NOWHERE. I have reached a point where I would rather run the risk of THE BOMB or even decapitation at the hands of a terrorist than to, grant this insidious, avaricious COOKIE MONSTER one more penny of my money, one more ounce of my freedom.

The purpose of Christianity of Jesus Christ is to create, develop, perfect character. Character is what I am in the sight of God, in the inmost recesses of my being; not what I seem to be nor what I would like others to think I am, but what I am in thought an purpose, in work and in deed. Character is the summing up of all I have thought and said and done. How is it to be secured and strengthened? Paul gives the answer: ""By the grace of God."" Without it we cannot progress God-wards. With it, we can do all things. It may be had by seeking; its effectiveness may be demonstrated by using. ""By the grace of God."" we may grow into the likeness of of Christ, which is the realization of the Christian character. Rev. Joseph M.

CNBC called him out and his response was to get flustered and attack moderators ... He never did attempt to answer the question ... We saw the real Ted Cruz there.Next to last:  Donny Trump ... How much shibai can one man have, will he ever complete a thought?  If this were football he would have had 47 bullsh$t flags thrown on himThere 'sort of' award:  Jebbers Bush ... Didn't speak much, and didn't have much to say when he did other than ""I have a plan"" ... Appears clueless, his close sounded totally rehearsed ... He is so a decade and a half ago.

16471,United States presidential election 2016,Jeb Bush launches 'optimistic' campaign for president,"The problem with Jeb's ""premise that the most vulnerable in our society should be in the front of the line and not the back"" is that his party and his policy ideas stand to bolster the bank accounts of the rich, white, straight, Evangelical Christian man, and not the struggling single parent who works two jobs, takes public transportation to both of those jobs, and relies on Medicaid and food stamps to make sure that his/her kids get at least the bare minimum that they need to survive. How is Jeb going to help put those people in the front of the line when Medicaid and tangible possibilities for wage growth are being ferociously targeted by the GOP? Jeb must push rightward to excite the GOP base enough to win the primary, but the policies the right wants are the policies that further exacerbate the problems that keep the most vulnerable in our society at the back of the line, thus violating the very premise upon which he's based his core beliefs."

Other than that I don't see how he has anything to offer our country.. and anyway he'd just end up tanking us further when he decides to go bankrupt.. as he tends to do.

5918,United States presidential election 2016,Donald Trump run for president in 2016,"We need people to challenge the youth. To set high standards. To force people to meet or exceed those standards. Teach the youth the value of putting their time and money into achieving a goal. Save up to buy some new cloths, a car, save up for college. Garden with your kids ... teach them the value of hard work and how it will pay off in the end with patience and effort. Teach them the value of failure: trying again and again and learning from your mistakes well making good decisions until you succeed. The US can be great again.  Don't do everything for your children but challenge them to do well for themselves. Challenge them and give them constructive criticism as needed and emotional support. Challenge the youth instead of giving handouts and be surprised by their ability to rise to the challenge and surpass your wildest dreams and expectations for them. We can continue to be a great country but we must recover from our recent failures to inspire and lead the next generation that doesn't give them what they need but teaches them to work hard to get what they want for themselves."

1819,United States presidential election 2016,Donald Trump gets Sarah Palin power,"the 21st century illiterates are not those who cant read nor write, but those who cant learn, unlearn and relearn. Allan Toffler. Government all over the world is a poster paged crusade. you dont want to belief all marriages have happy ending as it cost you a life time divorce in search for the perfect spouse. Learn to appreciate the good side of your government, leave the unspeakable to the good heavens so that you reserve the left over sanity in you to train up your kids to become d good seeds of the society and of the entire human race. From the time of  George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, through till the time of Theodor Roosevelt, William Howard, Franklin D Roosevelt, John F Kennedy, Richard M Nixon, Ronald Reagan, George W Bush, & Barrack Obama. All government is for everybody and at the same time built for nobody. We need to find constructive channels to vent our opinions and citations whenever disapointment is metted down on us out of over anticipation. Its not that all government are bad but bad become worse when we expect too much from government. too much of it is like getting high on booze, cracks and opium in that in the end you just have to admit that you were so stupid beyond verbal description as your habit has taken a toll on you. you may need to read The Albion seed by David Hacket Fischer, Culture of honour and the Psychology of Violence in the South by Richard Nisbet & Dove Cohen. Always remember someday you may become the President. A man and his words are two common inseparable entity. You are what You preach. Humans kills humans, Apes kill apes. Humans and Apes are the same. Welcome to this planet of apes. But you dont necessarily need a tail between your legs to tell you are one of us.   Politics is nobody's father's business, so never take it so personal. Politicians are just regular businessmen from higher plane.  Your words today may be your undoing tomorrow as it may come knocking at your door step without a short notice. Dont stew yourself in your own juice before your goose is cooked. Chose your words carefully like a dignified crested rooster."

They desired to create life using the force. To their dismay, their plan backfired, creating the Chosen One (Anakin Skywalker); the very thing that could destroy the Sith. Where Plagueis saw danger, Sidious saw opportunity. The chance to use the Jedi's own legend to the Sith's advantage. Plagueis, being wise, sensed that Sidious was going to kill him so that he may take up his own apprentice. Plagueis fooled Sidious into thinking that he killed him. Plagueis then went into exile. After many years, he had learned that Sidious was killed by Anakin Skywalker who had also killed himself in the process. Knowing that he is safe from ever being destroyed by the Chosen One, he came out of exile. He then seduced Kylo Ren to the dark side and then used him to destroy the attempted New Jedi Order."

Democrats are fortunate to have Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton as top candidates, at least they focus on issues that matter to middle-class families, and not Wall Street executives and bank CEOS. We cannot afford any of these men to take the key to the White House this November. Ronald Reagan is turning in his grave seeing Ted Cruz and Donald Trump leading in all the polls.

The media controls who and how any candidate gets exposure , and they want to elect the nominees by expressing personal views on them from news station owners ( Turner , Murdoch ), and specific reporters/commentators own ideology, anyone who goes against the ""powers that be"" the media kills in an instant. As for the democrats and the republicans, they are two faces of the same coin, dominating DC politics to the benefit of their interest groups, and all elected to serve to represent the people are only playing games , saying one thing and doing another, but always to the benefit of the status quo, which is to fill the pockets of the VERY RICH- make no mistake, both top republicans and DEMOCRATS are super millionaires. This corruption has to be stopped. WAKE UP AMERICA."

Has she been elected to any Office? REALLY, why should we listen to anything she has to say.

I have been a Fox supporter for years but after the way Megyn Kelly attacked Trump in that first debate, I stopped trusting the last news media outlet that I thought was really fair and BALANCED. I think it's a great business decision. It gives him more free publicity and shows he's not afraid to stand up for his beliefs. Shows some of the traits a real leader should have. No one is perfect, but in this case I believe Fox lost a lot of viewers because of the way they attacked him. I don't blame him one bit for not wanting to help Fox News line their pockets off of his attendance at the debate. Good for you Trump!"

Trump should attend however he fears that they will ask him questions that are unfair. Nothing is unfair to ask when you are running for president. Trump has no international experience or knows one country from the next or who the players are in different countries. The man is scared that he will make an idiot out of himself and not be able to respond appropriately to some of the questions he has no knowledge of. Kind of like when he said ""Two Corinthians"" and then blamed the writer of his speech. Unreal."

Megan Kelly was very unprofessional in her line of questioning or should I say ' statement making' during the last debate.... Basically she's a model who is fed words through an ear piece from her puppet masters.... Trump is smart to teach Fox a lesson.... He is exercising his own power...

2502,United States presidential election 2016,Is Donald Trump really scared of Megyn Kelly?,"For someone that hardly ever follows politics, let alone watch a debate - I was totally appalled at the first debate hosted by Fox News! You call yourselves 'moderators' of the debate?? To me, it was more like 'antagonists'. It was totally disgusting. All those leading questions with the sole purpose of pitting the candidates against each other in personal attacks instead of questions about policy, qualifications and intentions. I felt for every candidate that night. And I don't blame Trump one bit for not wanting to be put in that same situation again. Fox News can't make it any more obvious that they are against Trump and are acting like it's their job to help his opponents undercut him any way they can. Disgusting. Like I said. Don't follow politics but am now because this country, specifically Washington needs to change. And another talking head in a suit spewing empty promises while using his position to line his pockets is not going to do it. I seriously thought that the media and all you News 'Professionals' were suppose to report the news. Not interject it with your own bias opinions and push those opinions on the public like you are the be-all and end-all authority on the subject. Megyn Kelly does come off as a pushy, opinionated and antagonistic trouble maker. I turn her off whenever she comes on. I can't stand the smug, know-it-all attitude she tries to 'report' the news with. Sorry Ms. Kelly, but someone should tell you that the news isn't all about you!"

I believe Trump is exemplifYing how to stand up to bullies.  Trump is a man with the backbone this country needs.  Trump is anything But afraid.  This twist the news has placed on this issue about being scared, it is so immature.  It's like the bully on the school yard play ground, It takes the Strongest,  Biggest person to stand their ground and walk away."
2520,United States presidential election 2016,Is Donald Trump really scared of Megyn Kelly?,If he can't handle her then he sure as hell cant handle being our president.

2524,United States presidential election 2016,Is Donald Trump really scared of Megyn Kelly?,CNN?. Seriously?

If CNN and the other media would simply let him shoot himself in the foot and suffer the consequences of his own foolish behavior maybe he would learn the world does not revolve around him. Just don't cover his every breath.  The world has gotten along fine without Donald Trump.  I know he sure hasn't added one thing to my life or happiness.  He is a narcissist.l. He is certain that life is contest to be won.  And he is more certain that he can win it.  It is all a calculation... a deal he is doing.  Let him lose.  It just might teach him a lesson."

His narcissism is extreme and should he obtain the political power he seeks, he will endanger us from world enemies we know and those we don't yet know.  He is also a billionaire with multiple palatial homes.  How can he even begin to relate to the average American citizen?  Remember the interview where he called a million dollars a ""small loan?"""

Mexico will pay for the wall, and very fast, when Trump stops all trade with Mexico, brings back all the manufacturing being done there by American companies , and leaves Mexico without the jobs they have stolen from American workers., and without anyone to buy their products. We don't need to trade with Mexico , Mexico can't survive without trading and selling to the USA ,no country on the planet can. The unfair one way trade deals the Obama administration has been making will stop. We will not continue buying more then we sell ,not just to Mexico , but also to Japan, China and Europe. Free Markets have to be fair trade markets, and we have to make the agreements to benefit the USA not Mexico. We'll see how fast Mexico renegotiates fair trade and the building of that wall and their controlling of illegal immigration when they lose the trade deals they now have."

992,United States presidential election 2016,Trump: Border wall will cost $8 billion,"Dear Congressman Jim Costa. My name is Bobby Flores, I was, AM a friend of your uncle the late Leroy Costa, of Fresno Ca. Leroy was an investor in property, his business name 1294 hair salon on wishon ave in fresno ca., is where i met him. Leroy owned part of the apartment complex at the nearest corner of his place of business, as well as owner of some additional property next to his place of bussines and home...Leroy Costa in that year was molesting me as a boy, in that year Mr. Congressman you were a State Assemblyman and Law Maker, who was about to run for Congress of the United States. Your uncle Leroy once told me he would cut Governor Gerry Browns hair on the runway at Fresno Airport. Leroy never mentioned you were a politician, I found this out on the next day after your uncle Leroy Costa was murder. On that day another molester name John came to my home asking for Leroys keys to his home because Sherice, Leroys daughter needed to remove items from his apartment before homicide detectives showed up to do their investigation (to remove evidence from a murder investigation site)., because YOU Mr. Congressman, then State Assembly (Law Maker) could not have any bad publicity while running for Congress, this is what was said to me by a close friend of your uncle Leroy Costa. Is it truth what John told me? I cannot tesify to Sherice statement, or your request. What I can TESTIFY in TRUTH is, prior to Leroy Costa death did he give me his 1964 chevy impala, champagne in color for my birthday January 15, 1968 on the day of a great giant walked the earth Dr. Martin Luther King. You Mr. Jim Costa were a giant then (state assembly), and continue to be today, but so was Leroy Costa. A Giant Mr. Congressman, Genesis 6:4., the verse found in the bible like unto the year of my 19(6:4) which was my gift from a Child Molester your uncle Leroy Costa, did his daughter  Sheriece, and you Mr. Congressman did deny me, my house the truth, and my car which is the righteous inheritance of mine, which included my crystal with a ivory unicorn in the center of it. Why? Well Leroy Costa cared for me, was molesting me, and he was born on January 15th, year unknown...I do not write to you to bring shame upon you, you may think I AM, but if you take into concideration your uncle is calling me from the spirit and reminding me daily! No the shame is mine Congressman because the Spirit wills me to confess the truth, and for years have I brought to you my truth, so has vengence been brought upon me, I AM acused of being a Child Molester, emails sent to me, puddles of muddy waters following me like a shadow that never leaves you, with swords and staves, to bring me down to with a shuvel (to shoel)...I hope the Costa Family enjoys their ride in my car, at my expense in the flesh and soul..."

Across the political spectrum, voters are making it very clear that the methods of the past need to stay there, and the future has begun. The time has arrived for change to what we've become used to, and willing to accept. The time has arrived for Bernie Sanders. Some are more comfortable with the known entity, and that's fine, but times are changing and voters can jump aboard and join the ride, or stagnate and be a part of our history, rather than the future."

4147,United States presidential election 2016,National poll: Sanders and Clinton neck-and-neck,"Progressives like Bernie's stances on the issues.  But we all must remember, must accept the facts.The President stands alone always, often in opposition to key members of his/her own Party and the majority of American citizens.  Both Hillary and Bernie believe strongly in the same ideals: both would in a heartbeat establish a single payer healthcare system equal to any in Europe; both would if they could provide every hardworking student with a debt-free education, and send the bills to Wall Street billionaires who have for too long gotten a free ride on the backs of the working class.  So the election should not be about what a candidate believes in, on promises made.  We should all vote on what can be accomplished.  Hold a wish in one hand and $5 in the other--which one will buy you a cup of coffee and a croissant?  I believe strongly in Bernie's ideals.  But I just do not believe for a moment that as president he will accomplish even one of his lofty goals, for he will stand in opposition in Washington to both moderate Democrats and Republicans.  President Obama, a pragmatic politician, has had to cajole, threaten and make compromises with Conservatives that have left a foul taste in the mouths of all Progressives. He has not accomplished all we wished to do.  But he has been a successful president.Hillary's goals for the American people are more modest...achievable.  She has been careful not to make promises no president can deliver on.  I will vote, not for the wish, but for the  achievable goals."

7513,United States presidential election 2016,National poll: Sanders and Clinton neck-and-neck,"Let's look at each candidate's base. Bernie Sanders carries youth & activist voters as well as the ability to carry independents. The prior 2 are PASSIONATE about Bernie as a candidate. It's important to note that the youth vote does not turn out for a candidate that they do not feel speaks to them. Considering $hillary does terribly with voters under 30 and not well with the 30-40 group either...those people are more likely to stay home were Hillary to get the nomination, thus leading to overall low turn out and no gains in the House or Senate. Now let's look at Hillary's base. Lifelong Rank-n-file and corporate Dems. The Democratic Party could nominate a Boulder named ""Blinky"" and Hillary supporters would still vote for it. That is why $hillary supports call the question of a Bernie Sanders nomination, ""irrelevant."" Maybe when they see today's polls where Hillary's 30 point national lead evaporated overnight to a national statistical tie (44-42). Personally, I could NEVER vote for Hillary in a general election and will simply write in Bernie Sanders. Of course corporate and rank-n-file Dems will say I may as well vote Republican. Not true. This would be a PUNISHMENT vote to the DNC & Third Way Dems. They have ignored and written off  those who made the Democratic party...PROGRESSIVES. If the DNC continues to ignore us and attempt to screw Bernie Sanders out of the nomination, they DESERVE to suffer 4 to 8 years of psychopathic GOP rule.

He also knows I may be able to have health insurance under Obamacare, but can't afford premiums, co-pays nor medication. Bernie knows that all Americans deserve to be treated equally, and deserve to have the same rights to good health and education. Want change?

They don't work, they don't pay any ""real"" taxes, they don't understand how the system works (or the world for that matter), they're being brainwashed, etc. What I say to all of you is you're repeating what's happened for generations. The elder generation becomes stagnant, stuck in their ways and demeaning the younger generation for their progressive views. At one point your parents said the same of you, and so on. You have amnesia about how your generation battled to better the world and say, fight against segregation, fight for women's rights, just to name a few. You fail to acknowledge the fact that we are doing the same thing you did, by making the world better for all and not excepting the idea things can't, or shouldn't change. You fail to acknowledge the fact that your generation has depleted SS, continued to trash our planet (maybe climate change wasn't mainstream, but it became increasingly evident in your day that humans were changing the world and its inhabitants for the worse) with no regard over how you leave it for us, your children, nieces, nephews, etc. You continuously voted for people that increasingly shipped our jobs to foreign countries, rolling over and accepting it. That, or just plain didn't pay attention. You fail to acknowledge the fact the economy has changed considerably since you've been young. You fail to realize that it's harder for our generation to get by with the same amount of income, let alone make the same income with the same amount of work. That it's not nearly as easy to raise a family of our own and/or buy a home as it was for you! It's harder for us to afford to get a college degree! I could go on forever. Guess what... Just because you see a few bad apples and make assumptions doesn't give you the right to bash the majority. Just because you don't agree with us entirely doesn't give you the right to bash us! I live in MN, just across the Red from ND and I can say that my generation isn't lazy! Some of us work 2+ jobs! We do pay ""real"" taxes. We are paying attention to how the world works and challenge the status quo, just as you had before us. We are a compassionate/passionate generation. We realize and do a lot more than you would like to admit. If you look at your children and think otherwise, maybe you should look back at yourself. Maybe you should ask yourself what you did to shape the way your child acts/thinks. Maybe you shouldn't have given them everything, ignored them, etc. Maybe you should stop with the do a I say, not as I do. Maybe you should take your own advise of, ""If you have nothing good to say, don't say anything at all."" Maybe you should look at us as a hole, in our intirety! Guess what elders... Your time on this planet is coming to an end much sooner than ours and we deserve a say in how it is shaped just as much as you. Get off your high horses and shove off! Having said all this, their are still dreamers among you. People looking to better the world around us no matter what the cost/what it takes. People that do care about how things will be when they are gone. People that look to our generation with a sense of pride and hope. I commend you for biting your tongue and not making them same mistakes some of your peers are. To my generation... If you aren't already, do your research! Be informed and take on your responsibilities in this world, including the responsibility of voting in people that dream big and better this world. Don't listen to what others have to say. Don't be scared out of going with your heart and brain. Make informed decisions! Hold yourself responsible for your actions and how they effect not only yourself, but others, including those to come! Don't be afraid of the unknown! Instead embrace it! As we learn more and more, nothing comes easy! I stand by my endorsement of Bernie Sanders proudly! I stand by my view that he is not only a more genuine, caring person than Clinton and would be a better leader!

A self loathing Jew - BERNIE SANDERS SPENT MONTHS AT MARXIST-STALINIST KIBBUTZBernie Sanders has a complicated history with Israel. Back in the 70s, he called for denying weapons to Israel before the Yom Kippur War. His voting record on Israel in the Senate was spotty at best. He called for ""aggressive normalization"" with the terror state of Iran at the Democratic debate. But defenders keep mentioning that he and his anti-Israel brother Larry, who is with the Green Party in the UK, spent time at a Kibbutz in Israel.When Bernie Sanders entered the race, there was a good deal of speculation in Israel which Kibbutz he was in. The Sanders campaign didn't seem interested in answering the question. Now we know why.In 1963, Sanders had told Yossi Melman that he had been at Kibbutz Sha'ar Ha'amakim as a guest of the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement.Israel had all sorts of Kibbutzim affiliated with various political movements. Hashomer Hatzair was about as bad as it got.Kibbutz Sha'ar Ha'amakim had been co-founded by Aharon Cohen, the Arabist, who was a regular critic of Israel and opponent of its policy. He was arrested for spying for the USSR in the 50s.Hashomer Hatzair was a Marxist organization. While the USSR purged most Zionist and Jewish groups, they waited until 1927 to ban Hashomer Hatzair making them the last group to be outlawed. Other left-wing groups described them as Leninist and even Stalinist."

Wonder if Hillary even knows it or not - its not a group it is major drug gangs intent on destroying lives - 1,000s of lives - not just 3 and an Ambassador, but 1,000s all across the USA - Yes Hillary must be on drugs as well - or living in a fantasy world with Bill - please Hillary reference:  60 MINS.

If the Bernie supporters listen to their candidate well, they'll understand that they must stay involved continuously after the easy step of placing a vote, and most citizens just don't and won't. Revolutions will require peaceful demonstrations, marches, electing like-minded individuals in every election. Women didn't earn the right to vote, and other important rights, by merely voting. Ask yourselves if you're ready to do what it takes to create this revolution of which you yearn. HRC really means it when she says she'll work her heart out to make this a better world. Don't let the millions the GOP are spending to annihilate Hillary influence you to vote against many of the things we Dems hold near and dear. Neither candidate is perfect(who is?), nor is the two party system perfect by any means, but after a comparison on many levels, it's GO HRC all the way!! For anyone who is on the fence, I encourage you to watch HRC's '08 concession speech. It's a poignant speech and a clear indication of where Hillary's heart has been for a very long time."

MOE 4.5%Public Policy Polling (Feb 2-3) has Clinton 53, Sanders 32. MOE 4.3%Pollsters got it wrong in Iowa with the Republicans and someone is *way* off right now if two polls at same time declare a 21-point lead and a 2-point lead. Who's right? Time will tell."
